# Introduction

This is a very short introduction to some of the processes and tools we use when working in bioinformatics. 

This is not meant to be anywhere near comprehensive, you will be shown a few of the fundamentals, and one walkthrough of a single bioinformatics 'pipeline'. 

The *main* difference between Bioinformatics and the data analysis you have done before is the **size** of the data. Bioinformatics usually deals with sequencing data, and this data has large file sizes.

Handling **big data** means you need to know how to operate on a supercomputer so we will be learning a little bit of Linux, processing **big** data into **small** data and then exporting into R to make some more amazing data visuals and interpret our findings!





**DON'T** worry if you don't understand everything

**DO** ask lots of questions! 



```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')

knitr::opts_chunk$set(message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE)
```

```{r klippy, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}
klippy::klippy(c('r', 'bash'), position = c('top', 'right'), tooltip_message = 'copy to clipboard', tooltip_success = 'Copied!')
```
