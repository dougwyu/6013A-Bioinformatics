This is not meant to be anywhere near comprehensive; you will be shown a few of the fundamentals, and one walk-through of a single bioinformatics ‘pipeline’. One of the main differences between Bioinformatics and the data analysis you have done before is the size of the data. Bioinformatics usually deals with sequencing data, and this data has large file sizes. Handling big data means you need to know how to operate on a supercomputer so we will be learning a little bit of Linux, processing big data into small data and then exporting into R to make some more amazing data visuals and interpret our findings!
